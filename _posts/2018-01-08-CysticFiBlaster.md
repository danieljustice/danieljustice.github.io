## Overview

Cystic FiBlaster is a mobile game designed to help adolescents living with cystic fibrosis learn more about their condition in the context of their body and encourage adherence of their complex medication regimen.

### Controls
Use the joystick on the screen, WASD or the Arrow keys to move around. You will automatically shoot as fast as possible!

### The Vision
What you see here is a vertical slice of the game within an entire application that would educate children with Cystic Fibrosis on their condition. They would be able to choose which of their medications they would like to play. The player would then be transported to a part of the body and would battle their way to defeat a boss representing a symptom that was negatively affecting the player in real life. 

In this slice you can battle your way through lungs infested with bacteria and mucus to finally defeat Staphylococcusaurus. For an even more in depth explanation of this game check us out on our [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/fibros)!
